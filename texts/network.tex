Looking at \cref{fig:example}, we can clearly that every link is connected to a node of degree 1 and the central node, with degree $N-1$. Therefore, $e_{1,N-1} = 1$ when $N > 1$ and $e_{i,j} = 0$ for any other distinct pair $i,j$.

From this, we get \[
    q_1 = \sum_{j = 1}^N e_{1,j} = e_{1,N-1} = 1
\]

Similarly, we reach $q_{N-1} = e_{1,N-1} = 1$. For $i \ne 1$ and $i \ne N-1$, however, $q_i = 0$.
