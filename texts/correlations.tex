\section{Degree Correlation Coefficient}

The Degree Correlation Coefficient $r$ is equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient for network degrees and is given by
\[
    r = \sum_{j k} \frac{j k \left(e_{j,k} - q_j q_k\right)}{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{j k} j k \left(e_{j,k} - q_j q_k\right)
    \tag{7.11} \label{eq:coefficient}
\]

Where $\sigma^2$ is comparable to the variance and is given by
\[
    \sigma^2 = \sum_{k} k^2 q_k - \left(\sum_{k} k q_k\right)^2
    \tag{7.12} \label{eq:variance}
\]

\subsection{Numerator}

    The numerator, here represented as $C$, is
    \[
        C = \sigma^2 r = \sum_{j k} j k \left(e_{j,k} - q_j q_k\right)
    \]

\subsection{Denominator}

\subsection{Result}

    Finally, we can compute the degree correlation coefficient as
    \[
        r = \frac{?}{\sigma^2} = ???
    \]
