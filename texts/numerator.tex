\section{Numerator}

The Degree Correlation Coefficient $r$ is equivalent to the Pearson correlation coefficient for network degrees and is given by
\[
    r = \sum_{j k} \frac{j k \left(e_{j,k} - q_j q_k\right)}{\sigma^2} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{j k} j k \left(e_{j,k} - q_j q_k\right)
    \tag{7.11} \label{eq:coefficient}
\]
